I currently teach **AIML 901: AI Foundations for Managers** at Kellogg, an immersive lab-format course where MBA students go from AI outsiders to AI insiders in just five weeks. The course focuses on *actually building* with generative AI—because the best way to understand this technology is to use it. Students create their own AI agents, learn how large language models really work under the hood, and develop the skills to leverage AI in real business contexts.

What makes this course special is watching students transform their domain expertise into genuinely valuable AI applications. By the end of the quarter, each student has built a working AI agent tailored to a problem they deeply understand—whether that's streamlining operations at a previous employer or prototyping a startup idea. The results are consistently impressive, and I'm incredibly proud of what my students accomplish.
