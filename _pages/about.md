I am an assistant professor of Operations at the [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/), Northwestern University. This website presents my research, teaching, and other activities.

My research focuses on the intersection of large-scale optimization and operations management, using methods from optimization, machine learning, and applied probability to model and tackle real-world problems. Applications include transportation systems and school operations. For example, I helped [design Lyft's matching algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUEvoqR3D3M), [redesign Boston's school transportation system](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf), [change the school schedules of San Francisco](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4324076). These changes save tens of millions of dollars every year and benefit millions of people.

I also work on the use of AI to improve operations in the private sector. For example, I am an advisor to ESAB corporation's CEO on the use of AI to improve the company's operations.
