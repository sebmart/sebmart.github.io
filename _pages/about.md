I am an associate professor of operations at the [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/), Northwestern University. This website presents my research, teaching, and other activities.

My research focuses on the interface of algorithms and operations management, with applications to AI, public sector operations, and transportation.  Applications include transportation systems and school operations. For example, I helped [design Lyft's matching algorithm with reinforcement learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUEvoqR3D3M), [redesign Boston's school transportation system](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf), [change the school schedules of San Francisco](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4324076). These changes save tens of millions of dollars every year and benefit millions of people.

At Kellogg, I am also working on leveraging AI for higher education. I created Kellogg's first AI TA and introduced the concept of AI case studies, which are ways to use AI to improve teaching and learning. I also work on the use of generative AI to improve operations in the private sector. For example, I am an AI advisor to ESAB corporation's CEO.
