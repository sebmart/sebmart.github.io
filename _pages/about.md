I am an assistant professor of Operations at the [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/), Northwestern University. You can use the menu to explore my work. 

My research focuses on optimization, machine learning, and applied probability to model and tackle real-world problems. Applications include operations management, transportation, public sector and the human-AI interface. For example, I helped [design Lyft's matching algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUEvoqR3D3M), [redesign Boston's school transportation system](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf), [change the school schedules of San Francisco](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4324076). These changes save tens of millions of dollars every year and benefit millions of people.
