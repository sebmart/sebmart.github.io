Proud to launch the [**AIML901 Project Showcase**](https://sebastienmartin.info/aiml901/showcase/)—a collection of student projects from my AI Foundations for Managers course at Kellogg. These MBA students built real AI agents tackling everything from healthcare to personal productivity, with pitch videos and working prototypes. A testament to what's possible when business minds meet cutting-edge AI tools.
