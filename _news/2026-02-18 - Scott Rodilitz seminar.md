Thrilled to host [Scott Rodilitz](https://scottrodilitz.com/) from UCLA Anderson for our Operations Seminar Series! Scott presented "Offline and Online Optimization of Suggested Donation Amounts," a great talk on how nonprofits and platforms can optimize donation suggestions. Very excited about his work at the intersection of online platforms and social good!
