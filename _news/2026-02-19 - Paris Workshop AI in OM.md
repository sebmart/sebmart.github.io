Excited to present our work on Human-AI Interactions and Societal Pitfalls at the [Paris Workshop on AI in Operations Management](https://business.rice.edu/paris-workshop-ai-operations-management) (April 28-29) at the Rice Global Paris Center! This is joint work with [Francisco Castro](https://franciscojcastro.com/) (UCLA Anderson) and [Jian Gao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jian-gao-canada/) (UCLA Anderson). Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10448) explores how AI use can lead to homogenization and societal bias — and what happens when AI is trained on its own output.
