I was invited by the [National Academy of Engineering](https://www.nae.edu/) to present my work on reinforcement learning in transportation. This was part of the [China-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium](https://www.naefrontiers.org/206486/2024-ChinaAmerica-Frontiers-of-Engineering-Symposium).
