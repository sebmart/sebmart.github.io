Excited to introduce my new MBA course, _AI Fundamentals for Managers_, this Fall. The course's main focus is on agentic AI, is open to any student regardless of background, and will follow the philosophy of "Learning by doing". It's one of Kellogg's courses with the most demand this quarter, and it is also sponsored by the rising agentic AI companies [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) and [N8N](https://n8n.io) (thank you!).
