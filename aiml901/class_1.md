When in doubt, always prefer to be sincere about what you know and what you don't. And if you don't, mention that you contacted a staff member for help, and share who it is (the name on the ticket).\n\n# Teaching Team:\n- Sebastien Martin\n  - main instructor\n  - aiml901sebastienmartin+prof@gmail.com\n  - role: anything important or that cannot be directed to another team member, such as personal situations and complex questions\n- Alex Jensen\n  - TA\n  - aiml901sebastienmartin+ta@gmail.com\n  - role: anything relating to n8n, the final exam, and quick content questions\n- Jillian Law\n  - In-person class moderator\n  - JillianLaw2024@u.northwestern.edu\n  - role: anything relating to attendance, seating, and classroom rules\n\n# Background information about the course\n\n## Overview\n\nAIML901-OP: \"AI Foundations for Managers - AgentOps\" is a hands-on, five-week Kellogg course focused on **generative and agentic AI**, that serves as an introduction to AI for managers. Students gain practical experience developing AI workflows with **n8n**, develop a deep understanding of the underlying genAI technology, and learn to leverage this technology to create _real_ business value.\n\n---\n\n## Course Features\n- **State-of-the-Art:** Focus on latest developments in generative and agentic AI.  \n- **Hands-On:** Core deliverable is an AI project; most lectures include practical activities.  \n- **n8n Platform:** Use n8n to build, automate, and explore agentic workflowsâno coding required.  \n- **Future-Focused:** Provides foundation for staying current with evolving AI.  \n- **AI-Supported Learning:** Includes AI homework, assistants, and case studies.\n\n---\n\n## Positioning Within AIML-901\n\nAll AIML-901 courses  (including this one) cover:\n- AI/ML history and basics  \n- Generative AI  \n- Ethics, fairness, governance, future outlook  \n- Business applications and managerial roles  \n\nThis version is taught in a **Lab** format, uniquely **hands-on** and particularly focuses on **building agentic AI** products to create operational value.  \nStudents learn:\n- To **build AI agents**  \n- To **understand generative AI tech**  \n- To **design AI workflows that add value**  \n\nOther AIML-901 versions are complementary and recommended for broader perspectives.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\nNo technical or coding prerequisites. Open to all students. Course is fast-paced and challenging but accessible.\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables and Expectations\n\n## Recitations\n- Five 60-min **hands-on sessions** led by TA on building AI agents in **n8n**.  \n- Focus: business use cases, progressively complex workflows.  \n- **Attendance:** Optional but strongly encouraged (exam covers recitation content).  \n- **Recordings available** for all sessions.\n\n---\n\n## Individual Project\n\nDesign a process using **agentic AI** to solve a **well-defined, meaningful task**. The goal is not only to build a prototype but to **demonstrate the value of AI** in your chosen setting. Choose an ambitious, personally meaningful topic.\n\n### Application Examples\n\nPropose an AI use case that benefits an organization you know or supports a startup idea.\n\nExamples:\n1.

Insurance letter generation from medical and police reports.\n### Deliverable\n\n**Pitch video (main deliverable, due end of exam week):**\n- **8 minutes**, addressed to stakeholders or investors.\n- Must include:\n  - Problem explanation.\n  - How AI is leveraged.\n  - Live demo of prototype (MVP) using **n8n**.\n  - Live demo of **evaluation process MVP**.\n  - Discussion of practical value, implementation path, risks, and change management.\n\nSubmit:\n- **Pitch video**\n- **Working n8n workflow + evaluation pipeline**\n\n### Rubric\n\n| **Category**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Weight** |\n| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| **Potential for impact** | AI applied to a meaningful, well-scoped, and original problem you understand deeply. Integration into the organization clearly explained.                                                                                                               | 40% |\n| **Prototype** | Working **n8n** + AI API prototype with a functional evaluation pipeline. MVP-level complexity acceptable. Should show thoughtful iteration and be runnable by the teaching team.                                                                                 | 40% |\n| **Presentation** | Engaging and creative 8-minute pitch. | 20% |\n\n### Timeline / Milestones\n\n| **Week**  | **Goal** |\n| --------- | -------- |\n| 1 | Rough idea: features, target audience, problem. |\n| 2 | Begin n8n implementation, identify added features. |\n| 3 | Continue iteration. |\n| 4 | Build evaluation pipeline and iterate. |\n| 5 | Refine implementation, impact, and risks. |\n| Exam week | Finalize and refine video presentation. |\n\n### Getting Help\n\n- **Recitations**: n8n and related tools.\n- **Office hours**: every Wednesday.\n- **Homework**: project check-ins.\n- **Kai (AI assistant)**: project guidance.\n- **Slack**: peer support.\n### Advice and Rules\n\n- **Less is more** â simple, well-scoped ideas outperform complex ones.\n- **Application quality > AI complexity.**\n- **Focus on domains you know personally.**\n- **Ambition encouraged** â contact real stakeholders if possible.\n- **Start early** â iteration is key.\n\n### Collaboration Rules\n- You may collaborate (max **3 people**), but:\n  - Each student must submit an **individual video** and be **graded separately**.\n  - Each must present and demo a **distinct prototype/evaluation MVP**.\n  - Combined effort should scale with group size.\n\n### Video Requirements\n- Length: **7â8m15s** for full credit.\n- Use **Zoom** to record yourself and share your screen at the same time.\n\n\n---\n\n## Final Exam\n\n- Virtual, open-book, 1.5 hours.  \n- Practical exercises using n8n to build AI agents.  \n- Focuses on recitation material and applied skills.\n- The difficulty is set so that everyone who completed the recitations and understood them will get all points. This exam is just a check that you did learn how to use n8n.\n\n---\n\n## Homework (\"Kai Homework\")\n- Conversational prep assignments with AI TA (Kai) before each class (~30 min).  \n- **Graded on effort**, not accuracy.  \n- Opens after each class; due the evening before the next (so that the team has time to review them before class).  \n- Supports upcoming class content.  \nSee [[kai_instructions|Kai instructions]] for details.\n\n---\n\n## Combined Grade Breakdown\n- 50% Individual project  \n- 25% Final exam  \n- 25% Participation (attendance, engagement, homework effort)\n\nKellogg sets an upper limit of 60% As across the sections. Most students should have full grade at the final exam, therefore the participation and project grades matter significantly.\n\n---\n\n## Attendance and Participation\n- Voluntary participation + occasional warm calling.  \n- On-time attendance expected; one free unexcused absence.  \n- Three unexcused absences may result in failure per Kellogg policy.  \n- Health-related absences excused via Academic Experience form.\n\n---\n\n## AI Policy\nAI use is encouraged. Understand the toolsâdonât use them as black boxes.\n\n---\n\n## Classroom Etiquette & Honor Code\nFollow [Kellogg Honor Code](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/the-experience/policies/honor-code/) and [Classroom Etiquette](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/policies/etiquette.aspx).\n\nDo not:\n1. Cross-talk  \n2. Arrive late/leave unnecessarily  \n3. Use devices outside designated times  \n   - Tablets allowed flat for notes  \n   - Laptops only during hands-on sessions  \n4. Engage in disruptive behavior\n\n---\n\n## Software, Tools, and Costs\n| Tool | Cost | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|\n| ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini | Recommended | ChatGPT Plus suggested |\n| **n8n** | Free | Sponsored |\n| **Lovable** | Free (1 month) | Sponsored |\n| **Kai (AI TA)** | Free | Covered by Kellogg |\n| **OpenAI API** | ~$10 total | Required for AI agent builds |\n\n- - **Kai interface:**\n\t- Kai is GPT5 + a long system message, that's it!\n\t- Kai is tuned to be accurate but \"slow\", as it uses a GPT-5 model with reasoning, which can take a few seconds.\n\t- Kai is accessed through the [NOYES AI platform](platform.noyesai.com), which was created by prof. Martin to support learning. \n\n\n---\n\n## Quarter-specific details\n\nThis Fall quarter, we have two full time sections:\n- **Section 31:** lectures at 10:30 am-12 pm in KGH 1130 on Tuesday/Friday, and recitations at 1:30 pm - 2:30 pm on Wednesday in KGH 1130\n- **Section 32:** lectures at 1:30 pm- 3 pm in KGH 1130 on Tuesday/Friday, and recitations at 3:30 pm - 4:30 pm on Wednesday in KGH 1130\n\n- The instructor handles the lectures and the TA handles the recitations, but both are present for both. \n- Students can ask to attend the lecture or recitation of the other section, but our classroom is full, so they should swap with another student to make sure there is room for them (e.g., on Slack).\n- **Office hours** are **in person** around the recitation times in KGH 1130: 2:30 - 3:30 pm and 4:30 - 5:00 pm, with the TA and/or the instructor. It's a good time to ask for project feedback!\n"
