# Other Resources

## n8n's Built-in AI Assistant

Within n8n, there is an AI assistant within your workspace. You are able to ask it questions about your specific workflow, errors you are facing, and different nodes/triggers that are available to you. 
## n8n Templates

[Here is a link](https://n8n.io/workflows/) to various workflows that others have made. You are free to use these as a starting point for your own projects.
## n8n Documentation

n8n provides pages that explain all of the options for each node. Some of these pages are more comprehensive than others, but they do give a good sense of what is possible.
## n8n Community

If you run into an error and you are unable to understand it using the AI Assistant and ChatGPT, it is likely that others have encountered this error, as well. n8n has an [extremely active community](https://community.n8n.io/) where people ask and answer questions. This is a great place to look for solutions, workarounds, and advice.
## YouTube

There are many YouTube tutorials on building different workflows. While many of them focus on automation and do not go in-depth on _why_ they are making certain decisions, this can still be useful in gaining practice with the interface and different types of nodes.
