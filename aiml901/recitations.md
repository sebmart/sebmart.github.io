# Overview

This page contains recitation materials, recordings, and resources for learning n8n. Materials will be posted as the course progresses.

# Recitation Structure/Timing

Each recitation will consist of **core content** and possibly **exploratory content**. Core content is needed for the recitation homeworks (see below), while exploratory content is simply to showcase what is possible with n8n and give you ideas for your project. 

We will have 5–10 minute demos/"create with me" periods, where you will either see a workflow or build it along with the instructor, followed by time to explore on your own and ask/answer questions.

# Recitation Homeworks

There will be several n8n homeworks released during the quarter that will ensure that you are following along with and understanding the recitations. These are not meant to trick you, but rather to make sure that you are up to speed.

These recitations will be entirely screenshot-based. The homework will contain approximately 3 questions per recitation. These questions will ask you to run the workflows from the recitation (showing that they ran successfully) or to identify parts of the workflow. 

Recitation homework will open each at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday night and will close exactly one week later. **We highly recommend answering these questions as you complete the recitations.** This will ensure that you know both the terminology of AI, as well as that n8n is working properly.

# Recitation Materials

For each recitation, there will be a webpage, containing instructions on how to build the workflow for the recitation, as well as later on a video version of the recitation for those who are not able to make it to the in-person time. Note that the webpage will contain instructions on *what* to build, but not necessarily *why* we are doing it that way; the video is meant to complement this.

## Recitation 1

# n8n Resources

## n8n's Built-in AI Assistant

Within n8n, there is an AI assistant within your workspace. You are able to ask it questions about your specific workflow, errors you are facing, and different nodes/triggers that are available to you.

## n8n Templates

[Here is a link](https://n8n.io/workflows/) to various workflows that others have made. You are free to use these as a starting point for your own projects.

## n8n Documentation

n8n provides pages that explain all of the options for each node. Some of these pages are more comprehensive than others, but they do give a good sense of what is possible.

## n8n Community

If you run into an error and you are unable to understand it using the AI Assistant and ChatGPT, it is likely that others have encountered this error, as well. n8n has an [extremely active community](https://community.n8n.io/) where people ask and answer questions. This is a great place to look for solutions, workarounds, and advice.

## YouTube

There are many YouTube tutorials on building different workflows. While many of them focus on automation and do not go in-depth on _why_ they are making certain decisions, this can still be useful in gaining practice with the interface and different types of nodes.
